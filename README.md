# My Dotfiles
Just some configs for things I like to use


# TODOS
- Try out 'basedpyright' for python lsp
- [substitute mode]
- [molten.nvim](https://github.com/benlubas/molten-nvim/blob/main/docs/Not-So-Quick-Start-Guide.md)
- Save open buffer state after :qa
- Figure out issues with conflicting keymaps (see which-key's checkhealth)
- Enhance debugger (switch to lua api, add more functionality)
